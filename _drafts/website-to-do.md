# The TO DO List

Current state of the website:
- I have the bare functionality working. Links, sections, publications, ability to publish to multiple areas all work now. 

To Do:
- Add social buttons to left bar
- Round the opposite corners of the pic
- Add photo of me to main page? - Instead of or as well as name? 
- Style... I have the web structure working. I have to decide if I want to adopt a different gem or start modifying the one I have
- Fix links on the main page
- Content^3
- Consistent headers on each page
- Consider a blog section, or is this personal? For advice and things like this. 

Assuming I keep my gem the same
- Fix the listings of the projects for now so they look nicer. 
	- later... Look into migrating to a picture per post
- Add in intro for each page before list
- The personal projects header used to align with the maker of things. It's changed when i changed the post type. 
- Make sure the posts are consistent. There's a bunch of different page templates when it converts the markdown. Check consistency of this.
