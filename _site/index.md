## About Me

Hello! A little about me. I'm Irish, 31, and mad about tech. My interests are technology and how it can be used to make people's lives better. 

### The CV Bit

**Academically** I have a PhD in Computer Science from Imperial College London. I also have a masters in Nanotechnology and an undergraduate in Mechatronic Engineering from DCU, Ireland. I'm a visiting researcher at the Alan Turing Institute in the British Library and a member of the Network of Excellence in Air Quality (NExAir). I've multiple patents and publications, check out my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?user=FFjIW-wAAAAJ&hl=en) to learn more. 

I've a list of academic projects I have worked on over the past decade, click on the funky science hat below to learn more. Here's a write up on one piece of work I'm particularly proud of: [Battery Longevity](https://www.wikipedia.org)

**Professionally** I have 10 years professional experience across startups (SolarPrint, Domus.ai and Glanaer), Multinationals (Boston Scientific and Intel Research Labs), and Academia. Currently, I have joined [Entrepreneurs First](https://www.joinef.com) London cohort to persue my next startup opportunity.

**Personally** I have an interest in sparking a sense of creativity to encourage children to engage with STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Maths) subjects. particularly, I'm interesting in seeing how art can be included (STEAM) to show how these disciplines can be a creative rewarding persuit. 

Other stuff... I play the guitar and saxophone (Very poorly), done some long distance walking and cycling (I've done 3 [caminos](https://www.wikipedia.org)!), and like board and strategy games (My [hearthstone](https://www.hsreplay.net) nerd cred).  Join me for a pint below if you want to learn more about my personal projects. For the highlight, check out a global hackathon I ran with Stanford university [here](https://www.wikipedia.org).
