      <h2>Hot Take: The Internet is Making Us Sad</h2>
<time>Mar 15, 2019</time>

<hr />

<p>My hot takes are a space for me to chat through my half baked ideas. I’ll leave the definition of a hot take to my good friend Penis Armada from urban dictionary.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/hottake.jpg" alt="Hot Takes" class="img-responsive" /></p>

<p>The internet is making us sad. Now I don’t think this point is a particularly hot take. It’s widely understood that social media is generally a net negative on a persons mental health.  What I want to talk about here is yet another, small, way in which the internet is screwing us. It involves an interesting relationship between a fundamental piece of technology that helps the internet work and the psychological impact of colour.</p>

<h2 id="lossy-compression">Lossy Compression</h2>

<p>So what’s lossy compression? Straight basics. A bucket tonne of data is sent over the internet. To reduce the burden on our internet infrastructure, we compress data before transmitting it. There are two types of compression:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Lossless compression: Where the file is made smaller but the original data is preserved. Think zip files.</li>
  <li>Lossy compression: Where the file is reduced at the cost of losing some of the original data. It’s used a lot in image compression, as the result can be ‘good enough’.</li>
</ul>

<p>I’m interested in the good enough bit and I’m going to focus on the .jpeg image format as JPEG is used by 72.5% of all websites [<a href="https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/im-jpeg/all/all">REF</a>]. A good camera saves in photos in a RAW format, where every pixel from the camera is saved without any reduction in quality. However, these files can be 10-100MB’s. This is overkill for most websites where they’re viewed on lower quality screens or where absolute image reproduction isn’t paramount to the application. Many .jpeg images are in 10-100kB range, a thousand times smaller than the RAW format. So how is this reduction achieved?</p>

<p>Need to describe:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Reduction in quality. 8 pixels to 1</li>
  <li>Reduction per channel. Show how if you reduce green your eyes bleed. if you reduce blue, you don’t notice it as much (Need UG files for this)</li>
</ul>

<p>You can see from the above that reducing the blue channel of the photo has little impact on our perception of the quality of the photo. So blue is compressed more than the other channels to make the image good enough for the application. You may be asking yourself “Why should I care Greg Jackson?”. Well you should care. Blue is great. Let’s find out why.</p>

<h2 id="the-colour-blue">The Colour Blue</h2>

<p>The colour blue is historically the most expensive colour to produce. All blue, at one time, came from the semi-precious stone Lapis lazuli which was only found in one area of Afghanistan. This is why the virgin Mary is represented in the colour blue, rich renaissance patrons wanted the most expensive colours in the paintings they commissioned.</p>

<p>Blue is just really interesting. They did a study of mentions in literature of the colour blue. in Homers Odyssey, blue is not mentioned once. Apparently (According to a podcast on colour I listened to the other day), blue only starts crops up in literature about 3000 years ago. The blue cone of the eye is our most recent ocular addition.</p>

<p>What’s a cone you scream? Let’s look at the human eye. So there are cones and rods. Rods help you see in super low light levels and detect motion really well. Then you have three sets of cones to allow humans to see colour, broadly arranged in red, green, and blue colour areas. Underneath all of this, we have a third set called photo receptor cells.</p>

<p>These photo receptor cells don’t help us physically see things consciously. Rather they impact our bodies operation in a bunch of ways and are particularly sensitive to blue light. They tie back to a time where we lived in caves and fire was king. During the day humans would be out and about doing their hunting and gathering chores. Sunlight has a lot of blue in it so during the day we were heavily exposed to blue light. Then at night we’d be chilling out in our caves doing caveman things, the source of light would be fire which has very little to no blue in it, it’s a warm orange light. This baked into our bodies operation, over thousands of years, a fundamental relationship between light colour and our bodies operation. Blue light impacts our circadian rhythm. Blue light blocks the production of melatonin, our sleep chemical. Blue means daylight, activity, hunting, and bants. Warm light means caves, safety, and sleep.</p>

<p>We know seasonal affective disorder is a result of a lack of exposure to sunlight and there are SAD lamps to help those who move to less sunny places. Recent studies [<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867418310201">REF</a>] have shown a direct relationship, beyond impact on sleep, of daylight, and specifically the blue light, on our production of dopamine and serotonin. So blue light directly makes us happy and during the day should be maximized.</p>

<h2 id="put-those-hands-together">Put Those Hands Together</h2>

<p>My thinking is this, we undertake so much of our work, play, and social interaction during the day, indoors under artificial light, through the internet and screens. If the colour blue makes you happy and the internet strips out the colour blue as the conscious part of our brain doesn’t process it very well, then the internet is making us sad. That’s my hot take, there are many like it but this one is mine.</p>
