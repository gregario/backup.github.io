      <h2>Maker: Map Making</h2>
<time>Dec 31, 2018</time>

<hr />

<p>So I’ve a bit of a thing for maps, the history of mapping of the world is such an interesting read. Map makers used to purposefully put in mistakes in order to catch out people who would copy their work. I really like maps as interaction pieces too. They give a really nice platform for sharing data, visualizing digital information on physical objects makes them more tangible somehow. I have three projects I’ve done with maps I’m going to share here together, as they are a work in progress. I’ll break them out into individual posts as the work progresses.</p>

<h2 id="enfield-map">Enfield Map</h2>

<p>I don’t have a thingiverse link for this map as I think that it’s not sharable. I did the work with Steve Gray of Casa, a very good designer and resident computer scientist extraorinaire. The idea of this work in progress project is to create a map of an area as a physical object. We would then drill RGB LED’s into the map at the location of each of the air quality sensors we had deployed as part of the London Living Lab project described elsewhere on this blog. The map could represent the living breathing real time air quality data and, at a glance, the current air quality of the area could be understood.</p>

<h2 id="world-map">World Map</h2>

<p>This project never had a specific purpose but was rather an extension of the Enfield map idea. With this version a screen could be placed behind, instead of individual LED’s and the map could be used to represent any manner of things. Twitter sentiment data worldwide was one idea we had, potentially with user input of the topic.</p>

<p>If you would like to make of of these the Thingiverse link is <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:561951">here</a></p>

<h2 id="election-map">Election Map</h2>

<p>This project was a bit more analogue. We wanted something we could fill in as the election night in 2016 played out. We, erm, stopped filling it out before the end of the evening.</p>
