## About Me

Hello! A little about me. I'm Irish, 31, and mad about tech. My interests are technology and how it can be used to make people's lives better. 

**Academically** I have a PhD in Computer Science from Imperial College London, a masters in Nanotechnology and an undergraduate in Mechatronic Engineering from DCU, Ireland. I'm a visiting researcher at the Alan Turing Institute and a member of the Network of Excellence in Air Quality (NExAir). I've multiple patents and publications, check out my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?user=FFjIW-wAAAAJ&hl=en). Click on the funky science hat below to learn more about my academic projects. A highlight is [Battery Longevity](https://www.wikipedia.org)

**Professionally** I have 10 years professional experience across startups (SolarPrint, Domus.ai and Glanaer), Multinationals (Boston Scientific and Intel Research Labs), and Academia. Currently, I have joined [Entrepreneurs First](https://www.joinef.com) London cohort to persue my next startup opportunity. Follow othe happy dog in the tie to learn more about my professional career. A highlight is [Battery Longevity](https://www.wikipedia.org)

**Personally** I have an interest in sparking a sense of creativity to encourage children to engage with STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Maths) subjects through art. I play the guitar and saxophone (Very poorly), I've done 3 [caminos](https://www.wikipedia.org) by bike and walking, and like board and strategy games (My [hearthstone](https://www.hsreplay.net) nerd cred).  Join me for a pint below if you want to learn more about my personal projects. For the highlight, check out a global hackathon I ran with Stanford university [here](https://www.wikipedia.org).
